# setup-boundary

The `hashicorp/setup-boundary` action sets up the Boundary CLI in your GitHub Actions workflow.

After you've used the action, subsequent steps in the same job can run Boundary commands using [the GitHub Actions `run` syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsrun).

## Usage

This action can be run on `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, and `macos-latest` GitHub Actions runners. When running on `windows-latest` the shell should be set to Bash. When running on self-hosted GitHub Actions runners, NodeJS must be previously installed with the version specified in the [`action.yml`](https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-boundary/blob/main/action.yml).

The default configuration installs the latest version of the [Boundary CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/install?ajs_aid=2548f4b6-d9b0-45f2-9644-a469942b6f54&product_intent=boundary) and installs the wrapper script to wrap subsequent calls to the `boundary` binary:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: hashicorp/setup-boundar@v1
```

A specific version of the Boundary CLI can be installed:

```yaml
steps:
    - uses: hashicorp/setup-boundary@v1
    with:
      version: 0.15.4
```

Subsequent steps can access outputs when the wrapper script is installed:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: hashicorp/setup-boundary@v1

  - id: connect
    run: boundary connect -target-id ttcp_1234567890
```
## Inputs

The action supports the following inputs:

- `version` - The version of the Boundary CLI to install. Defaults to the latest version.

## Outputs
